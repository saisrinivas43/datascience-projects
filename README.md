# datascience-projects

I have been learning DataScience on my own and via DataQuest and Lynda courses, these websites offer guided projects with some help from the support team. This repository is to display the projects I have been working on with them. The idea behind publishing them in here is to showcase the work I have done for potential employers and the goal is to find a job where I can utilize my past experience and newly acquired skillset to to do large scale data analysis and machine learning projects with a progressive organization. Below is the objective and important notes of each project I have successfully completed.

### Used_Car_Sales_Analysis 
Objective of this project is to analyze if the price, mileage of an used car has any correlation to the brand of the car. The dataset and the project guidelines are provided by dataquest team. 

### Fandango Movie Ratings Comparison
In 2015, Walt Hickey has done an investigation to prove Fandago is inflating popular movie ratings. This data analysis is to check if they are continuing to so that after Walt Hickey's report. Dataset is scraped and put together by Dataquest team.
