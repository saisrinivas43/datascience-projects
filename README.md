# datascience-projects

I have been learning DataScience on my own and via DataQuest and Lynda courses, these websites offer guided projects with some help from the support team. This repository is to display the projects I have been working on with them. I would like to contribute to data analysis and machine learning projects from scratch in the long run. Below is the objective of each project.

### Used_Car_Sales_Analysis - 
This project is to derive if the price, mileage of a car has any correlation to the brand of the car. The dataset and the project guidelines are provided by dataquest team.
