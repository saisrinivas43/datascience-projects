# datascience-projects

I have been learning DataScience on my own and via DataQuest and Lynda courses, these websites offer guided projects with some help from the support team. This repository is to display the projects I have been working on with them. The idea behind publishing them in here is to showcase the work I have done for potential employers. The the goal is to find a job where I can utilize my past experience and newly acquired skillset to do large scale data analysis and machine learning projects. 

I have listed the objectives of each project below
