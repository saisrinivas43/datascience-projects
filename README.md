# datascience-projects

I have been learning DataScience on my own and via DataQuest and Lynda courses, these websites offer guided projects with some help from the support team. This repository is to display the projects I have been working on with them. I would like to contribute to data analysis and machine learning projects from scratch in the long run. Below is the objective of each project.

### Used_Car_Sales_Analysis 
Objective of this project is to analyze if the price, mileage of an used car has any correlation to the brand of the car. The dataset and the project guidelines are provided by dataquest team. 

### Fandango Movie Ratings Comparison
In 2015, Walt Hickey has done an investigation to prove Fandago is inflating popular movie ratings. This data analysis is to check if they are continuing to so that after Walt Hickey's report. Dataset is scraped and put together by Dataquest team.
